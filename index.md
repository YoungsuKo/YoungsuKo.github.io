  Hi, I am Yougnsu Ko! I am currently working as a research engineer in Hyundai Motor Company, where I am responsible for developing inverter software for electric drive system. My research interests focus on improving system reliability through the application of advanced techniques such as state estimation, parameter estimation, fault detection and identification, remaing useful life (RUL) prediction, and fault-tolerant control.

  Before joining Hyundai Motor Company, I received B.S. and M.S. in mechanical engineering from Konkuk University, South Korea.

  I am currently looking for a university and research lab for my PhD program.
